# XerahS Cloud web

Owner-only screenshot and screencast gallery for XIP0085. This is a Next.js 16 App Router application deployed to Vercel Sydney (`syd1`) with self-hosted Better Auth on Neon Postgres (`xerahs-cloud`, `aws-ap-southeast-2`), hosted Stripe Billing, and a private Cloudflare R2 operations ledger.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 24 and Corepack. From `web/`:

```powershell
corepack prepare pnpm@10.28.2 --activate
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Run `neon link` (or `neon env pull`) in `web/` to write the Neon connection strings into `.env.local`, then add `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. Without `RESEND_API_KEY`/`EMAIL_FROM`, development prints verification and reset links to the server log. Use a Neon branch, never `main`, for local work. Stripe and R2 can remain unavailable while working on non-billing UI; `LEDGER_USE_LOCAL_FAKE=true` is development/Preview only. Production startup fails closed when privileged configuration is incomplete or the fake ledger is enabled.

The project uses TypeScript 7's native `tsc` for application type checking and Next.js production builds. TypeScript 7.0 does not expose the compiler API used by `typescript-eslint`, so the ESLint toolchain is isolated in `tooling/eslint` with Microsoft's official `@typescript/typescript6` compatibility package. This separation keeps the application compiler on TypeScript 7 without running ESLint against an unsupported API.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Database migrations, RLS policies, the local seed and pgTAP tests live in `db/cloud/`. `00000000000000_supabase_compat.sql` recreates the small part of Supabase the XIP0085 SQL uses (the `anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role` roles and `auth.uid()`/`auth.jwt()` over `request.jwt.claims`), so those migrations run unchanged on plain Postgres. Apply migrations with `node scripts/db-migrate.ts --dir db/cloud/migrations`, never by editing the database by hand; test them on a throwaway Neon branch first. The web handlers depend on the narrowly granted RPCs documented in `openapi.yaml` and the migrations; `src/lib/database.ts` calls them the way PostgREST did (`SET LOCAL ROLE`, request claims, then the function).

The root workflows run the Node 24 application checks and a Postgres 17 migration, seed and pgTAP suite. Staging deployment is manual and protected until the Vercel and Neon environment secrets are connected.

## Security model

- Every owner/API response is dynamic and `private, no-store`.
- `src/proxy.ts` emits a per-request CSP nonce; auth and data are same-origin, so `connect-src` is `'self'`.
- Better Auth (`src/lib/better-auth.ts`) handles email/password with verified email, TOTP two-factor with backup codes, passkeys, and the desktop OAuth 2.1 server (authorization code + PKCE, ES256 access tokens for `/api/v1`). Its users and sessions are mirrored into `auth.users`/`auth.sessions` by triggers; a session is `aal2` only after a second factor or passkey is verified. Each desktop authorization is its own revocable session, so signing out everywhere also cuts off the desktop.
- Owner data requires a current `aal2` session. Email verification and recent strong authentication are checked for trial and billing operations.
- Cookie-authenticated mutations require the exact configured `Origin`; desktop bearer requests are not CORS-enabled.
- Publish accepts public HTTPS metadata only, derives titles from a leaf filename, strips URL fragments, and never server-fetches media.
- Stripe Checkout and Portal use fixed server configuration. The webhook validates the raw body, signature, mode, and event allowlist before a transactional database hook.
- Trial grants and deletion tombstones are written through a durable Postgres outbox. R2 writes use `If-None-Match: *`, `Content-MD5`, canonical SHA-256/HMAC envelopes, and fail closed on collisions.

Do not enable Stripe Tax until the operating entity has approved registrations and a product tax code. Do not place database, Better Auth, Stripe, R2, HMAC, webhook, email, or cron secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables.

## Provider setup

1. Use the Neon project `xerahs-cloud` in Sydney: `main` for production and a protected child branch for staging. Apply the reviewed migrations with `scripts/db-migrate.ts`, then register the desktop OAuth client with `node scripts/register-desktop-oauth-client.ts`. Configure Resend (or another sender) for `EMAIL_FROM`.
2. Create one Stripe Product with separate test/live monthly and annual Prices. Configure a restricted Customer Portal and signed environment-specific webhook at `/api/webhooks/stripe`.
3. Enable R2 billing, then run `node scripts/configure-cloudflare-r2.mjs` with a protected administration token and environment-specific `R2_BUCKET`. The checked-in desired state creates a private Standard/APAC bucket, disables `r2.dev`, applies the indefinite trial lock, and applies matching 180-day deletion lock/lifecycle rules. Runtime uses a separate bucket-scoped Object Read & Write token.
4. Configure Vercel environments independently, keep Preview protected, and deploy production only through protected CI.
5. Deploy `infrastructure/cloudflare/scheduler` with the same `CRON_SECRET` as Vercel (`wrangler deploy --env staging` or `wrangler deploy --env production`). Its Cron Triggers invoke the authenticated ledger-dispatch, account-deletion, and Stripe-reconciliation routes without requiring a Vercel Pro cron plan. The Worker is an outbound scheduler only and is not a proxy for application traffic.
6. Point Cloudflare DNS-only records to Vercel only after the production launch gates in XIP0085 are complete.

R2 enablement, paid provider plans, live billing, tax, production DNS, and traffic require the explicit cost/legal/tax/launch approvals in XIP0085. Once approved, the checked-in scripts and protected workflows apply and continuously verify the desired state.
