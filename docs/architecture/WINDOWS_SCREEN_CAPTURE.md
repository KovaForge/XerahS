# Windows Screen Capture Architecture

This is the authoritative description of how XerahS takes screenshots on Windows. It replaces the older region capture backend documents. Their `IRegionCaptureBackend` stack was never wired into the application and has been removed on every platform.

## Layers

```text
IScreenCaptureService (XerahS.Platform.Abstractions)          port used by the app
        │
WindowsScreenCaptureServiceFactory                             single composition point
        │
WindowsModernCaptureService / WindowsScreenCaptureService      thin facades: API call → ScreenCaptureRequest
        │
Capture/Engine        ScreenCaptureEngine                      runs the backend chain, handles fallback
                      CaptureBackendPolicy                     pure: which backends, in which order
                      ScreenCaptureRequest, CaptureRectResolver
                      IScreenCaptureBackend                    port implemented by each native API
        │
Capture/Backends      DxgiDesktopDuplicationBackend            DXGI Desktop Duplication
                      WindowsGraphicsCaptureBackend            Windows.Graphics.Capture (borderless)
                      GdiScreenCaptureBackend                  GDI BitBlt into a DIB section
                      TextureRegionReader                      GPU crop and readback shared by DXGI and WGC
        │
Capture/Wgc           GraphicsCaptureInterop                   WGC and D3D11 interop shared with screen recording
```

Dependencies point inwards only. The facades know the engine and the request type. The engine knows only `IScreenCaptureBackend` and the policy. Backends know their native API and the shared helpers. Nothing below the facade references Avalonia or the UI.

## Composition

`WindowsPlatform.Initialize`, `ShareXBootstrap` and `Program` all obtain the service from `WindowsScreenCaptureServiceFactory.Create`. The factory returns `WindowsModernCaptureService` on Windows 8 and later, otherwise `WindowsScreenCaptureService` (GDI only).

## Backend chain

| Order | Backend | Available when | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DXGI Desktop Duplication | Windows 8+ | Duplicates only the outputs under the request. Unrotated SDR outputs are cropped on the GPU. Rotated and HDR outputs read the whole output with rotation and tone mapping. |
| 2 | Windows.Graphics.Capture | Build 20348+ and borderless access granted | Runs only when DXGI returns nothing, for example on laptops with hybrid graphics where Desktop Duplication is unsupported. Never shows the yellow capture border. The cursor comes from `IsCursorCaptureEnabled`, so system cursors are not hidden. |
| 3 | GDI BitBlt | Always | Copies straight from a DIB section. It applies `HdrScreenshotColorCorrector` when enabled. |

`CaptureOptions.UseModernCapture = false` restricts every capture to GDI. A backend that throws or returns null hands over to the next one.

## Behaviour contract

These rules are covered by `WindowsCaptureEngineTests` and `WindowsModernCaptureServiceTests` and must hold for any change:

- Full screen captures span the union of the DXGI outputs, or the virtual screen on GDI and WGC.
- Rectangle captures on DXGI crop with `DxgiCropRectHelper`. When the outputs and the virtual screen differ in size the crop is scaled, so the whole desktop is captured and cropped.
- Rectangle captures on GDI and WGC round outwards and clamp to the virtual screen.
- The modern service captures windows as clamped rectangles. The GDI only service reads window bounds as they are.
- DXGI hides system cursors unless `ShowCursor` is true and composites the cursor afterwards. GDI hides them only when `ShowCursor` is explicitly false.
- Screen pixels are always opaque.

## Performance

Compared with the previous implementation in one class:

- Region and window captures on DXGI duplicate and read back only the monitors under the selection, not every monitor.
- Unrotated SDR outputs copy only the selected pixels off the GPU (`CopySubresourceRegion`) and write them straight into the result bitmap. No intermediate bitmap of the whole desktop and no second crop.
- DXGI cursor composition draws into an overlay the size of the cursor instead of the whole desktop. The PNG encode and decode of that overlay is gone.
- GDI captures read the DIB section directly instead of doing a PNG encode and decode round trip through `System.Drawing`.

## Verifying on Linux

`XerahS.Platform.Windows` skips compilation on Linux by default. To compile it, and the test project for the Windows target, run:

```bash
dotnet restore tests/XerahS.Tests/XerahS.Tests.csproj -p:OS=Windows_NT -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true -p:CsWinRTGenerateProjection=false
dotnet build --no-restore tests/XerahS.Tests/XerahS.Tests.csproj -p:OS=Windows_NT -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true -p:CsWinRTGenerateProjection=false
```

This proves the code compiles. Capture behaviour still has to be checked on Windows.
